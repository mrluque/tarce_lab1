## Description
Practice 1 of the subject TARCE (MUIT, course 1) with the tittle "Simple software with cloud access and mobility" </br> 

We have created a small Web portal of an Art Academy with different views depending on the chosen route and information managed through a database. This This  app can be visualized in the next link: [Heroku app](https://tarce-lab1-mrluque.herokuapp.com/). </br>

## Considerations
Starting November 28th, 2022, free Heroku Dynos, free Heroku Postgres, and free Heroku Data for RedisÂ® will no longer be available. For that reason, maybe the previous link won't work properly
